# Morlex

Ancient manuscripts are significant historical finds, but translation can be a slow and difficult process, even for languages only a few thousand years old. Is this an inherent problem of communication across the eons, or can a writing system be designed in a simple and intuituve way so that future people with no knowledge of our language and culture could decipher meaning with minimal work? Morlex is an attempt to accomplish this.

Morlex is named after the Morlocks, an intelligent (and sinister) race of human descendants encoutered in H. G. Well's *The Time Traveller*.

## Strategies

If there is no shared symbolism between ourselves and those we wish to share knowledge with, how can we imply meaning? We will assume that our distant descendents will share much of our basic human condition such as body shape and function. We will also assume they share a similar physical environment including the sky, earth, fire, water, time, plants and animals. 

### Core Lexicon

Simple drawings should be able to illustrate the meaning of common and important objects, actions, and qualities. This requires Morlex to be a pictographic language. The basic collection of these symbols will need to be small enough for a glossary to be included as an appendix to all Morlex manuscripts.

### Expanded Lexicon

Because the core symbol set only describes the simplest concepts, any sufficiently complex manuscript could quickly become unwieldy and verbose. It is expected that each author create their own glossary of symbols specific to their topic using the core pictogram set. When creating the custom glossary, care should be taken not to reinvent symbols that have already been created and are in common use.

### Proper Names

The names of specific places and creatures use a cartouche similar to ancient Egyptian Heiroglyphs. The pictograph of the type of thing being named (person, building, planet, etc.) should be at the left side of the cartouche. Other descriptors can follow the initial symbol until a unique combination fill the container. I would guess 3 to 5 extra pictogrphs would be sufficient. An attempt should be made to make the proper name consistent with any known manuscripts.

### Basic Grammar

Compound words can be formed by placing pictographs next to, but not touching each other. Words should be separated with a full, clear space. Sentences should start at the left and flow to the right.
