# Morlex

Ancient manuscripts are significant historical finds, but translation can be a slow and difficult process, even for languages only a few thousand years old. Is this an inherent problem of communication across the eons, or can a writing system be designed in a simple and intuitive way so that future people with no knowledge of our language and culture could decipher meaning with minimal work? Morlex is an attempt to accomplish this.

Morlex is named after the Morlocks, an intelligent (and sinister) race of human descendants encountered in H. G. Well's *The Time Traveller*.

## Language Design

A million years from now, there will be no relationship between any language from today, but the human condition will still be shared. We will still have eyes and ears, arms and legs. We will still eat food, talk with friends, and have children. The world be be assumed to have certain consistencies too. There will still be the sky, earth, fire, water, time, plants and animals. Drawings of these things can form the start of a shared language, and more advanced concepts can hopefully be built with those initial building blocks.

### Core Lexicon

Simple drawings should be able to illustrate the meaning of common and important objects, actions, and qualities. This requires Morlex to be a pictographic language. The basic collection of these symbols will need to be small enough for a glossary to be included as an appendix to all Morlex manuscripts.

### Expanded Lexicon

Because the core symbol set only describes the simplest concepts, any sufficiently complex manuscript could quickly become unwieldy and verbose. It is expected that each author create their own glossary of symbols specific to their topic using the core pictogram set. When creating the custom glossary, care should be taken not to reinvent symbols that have already been created and are in common use.

### Proper Names

The names of specific places and creatures use a cartouche similar to ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs. The pictograph of the type of thing being named (person, building, planet, etc.) should be at the left side of the cartouche. Other descriptors can follow the initial symbol until a unique combination fill the container. I would guess 3 to 5 extra pictographs would be sufficient. An attempt should be made to make the proper name consistent with any known manuscripts.

### Symbol Design

There is no requirement to write Morlex quickly, so symbols can be high quality illustrations of their meaning. All parts of Morlex symbols should be contiguous or enclosed so that individual symbols can be clearly recognized as separate. The printed size of a symbol should be a square approximately one square centimeter on its side.

### Basic Grammar

Compound words can be formed by placing pictographs next to, but not touching each other, in reading order of importance. For example, the noun should come first with adjectives listed afterward. Words should be separated with a full space equal to the size of a symbol. Sentences should flow from  left to right, top to bottom. The end of a sentence is indicated by the end of the line. It is recommended that sentences fit on a single line, but if that is not possible, the sentence can be continued on the next line indented a single symbol space. Paragraphs are divided by a single blank line. Section titles are centered and separated by a blank line above and below.

Writing systems nearly universally flow from top to bottom, but there is no clear preference for humans over left-to-right or right-to-left. Because Morlex sentences start flush at one side, the reading direction should be implied by the layout of the page. Morlex could be written both ways but I would prefer to choose one and stick to it. I just wish there was a compelling reason to pick on over the other. Changing the reading direction could also affect symbols if they are directional.

### Illustrations

Illustrations are a powerful tool for communicating, especially across a language barrier. They are a key part of Morlex documents and are encouraged, with proper rules. Illustrations must be at least twice as large as symbols. They must occupy their own horizontal space - no illustrations are allowed in the middle of sentences. They should also be contained in a rectangular frame.

## Media

If we succeed in creating a language with a quality of extreme decipherability, we still need to store it in a media capable of delivering our messages into the distant future. This media will need to be durable, not only resistant to being destroyed, but able to keep the symbols clear over vast reaches of time, temperature fluctuations, and moderate physical abuse. It will also need to be able to contain an entire Morlex manuscript without being too unwieldy. Because Morlex writing can take up a lot of space and must include core and extended glossaries, the minimum size of a manuscript might be about 100 pages long. The maximum size of a single manuscript will be determined by properties of the physical media.

## Core Symbol Set

This is where the majority of work needs to be done. Even after the first version is complete, testing by measure deciphering speed and comprehension by native speakers and a variety of languages will be necessary for proof of success and feedback for improvements,

### Numbers

The first section of the core glossary describes numbers. Morlex uses Arabic decimal numerals and mathematical symbols. The core math operators are +, -, x, /, and exponents. Mathematical operators double as word symbols:

- + is the conjunction *and*
- \- is the modifier *not*
- = is the verb *is*
- â‰ˆ is a verb meaning *similar to*, or *like*
- > *more*, *better*
- < *less*, *worse*
