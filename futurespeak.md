Speaking to the Future
======================

Sending a message to the future, be it hundreds, thousands, or millions of years from now has its own set of challenges that are very different than everyday usage. The proposed name for this language is Morlex, from the Morlocks in H. G. Wells' book *The Time Machine* and lexicon. And why would be want to communicate with the future? For the same reason history is valuable today: to share discoveries about our world and to warn against making our mistakes.

Pictographs
-----------

Though a phonetic alphabet was arguably a significant invention for the spread of literacy, messages to the future will be written only. Any focus on pronunciation is unhelpful. Simple pictographs not only eliminate information about sound, but can hint at meaning through shape, making learning the language easier.

Subvocalization or reading out loud should use the reader's native sounds.

Research will begin with study of ancient writing systems, plus popular modern attempts including ASL.

Translatability
---------------

Which brings me to the most important aspect of a language to the future: translatability. What makes something translatable will be an ongoing area of research. Fortunately, it can be tested (as long as the tested language does not significantly resemble the translator's native tongue.) I have a few ideas about making a text as translatable as possible.

###Glossary

All documents must be accompanied by a detailed illustration of all basic terms. The list of these terms should be as small as possible and chosen not only for common use, but for generic power. Small languages such as Basic English, Toki Pona, Up Goer Five, and Special English should also be studied.

I imagine three main glossary sections. One for mathematics. In addition to numbers, operators double as descriptive symbols, with =, ≠, >, <, +, -, × and / used as their literal meaning as well as mathematical. Math should also include the concepts of probability, and set inclusion. The second section describes the natural of form, position, matter, energy, and time. The last describes people specific terms.

###Jargon

New symbols crested for a specific document are encouraged as long as they are first defined with the base symbol set or previously defined jargon. (Also, jargon should never be created if a basic symbol already exists that would work as well.)

###Grammar

The layout and structure of Morlex should be implied without the need for a glossary lesson. Here are a few ideas:

* Symbols in a sentence are separated by a space of approximately the same with as a symbol unless a symbol specifically modifies another symbol. Modifiers should be placed next to each other with only enough space to clearly show they are separate. The order of a modifying group is not specified, and can be left to the author's preference.
* Sentences do not wrap lines. This way, the word order can be discerned from the common starting edge.
* Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.
* No punctuation other than line position

If the above rules are followed, reading direction does not need to be codified. The writer should be allowed to use whichever directional flow of sentences he or she desired, and it should be clear to the reader how it was meant to be read.

There are certainly more concerns with grammatical usage (how to phrase a question, for one) that should be identified once experimental documents are attempted.

Material
--------

If the language is intended to be read millions of years from now, then it must be written on something that has a chance of existing. Paper is not acceptable, nor is most digital storage media. Media for Morlex must be resistant to physical, chemical and thermal extremes. (Possible a tough plastic like nylon?) Even if a perfect media is discovered, how should the symbols be added to it? Engraving may be the best idea I have so far. Carved symbols should be resistant to wear and could be made to be read more easily by adding a temporary pigment that pools in the impressions. Inverse printings could also be made from the original carvings for temporary distribution.

Creation
--------

There should be several tests for the base Morlex symbol set. My first ideas are one describing the Periodic Table of the Elements. The second is recounting an historical story. Basic science and history are the target topics of Morlex, and their usage should be significantly different.

Morlex? Morlock + lexicon

Vocabulary
==========

Vocab should be in several types:

1. Scientific symbols for describing natural phenomena (space, time, matter, energy)
2. Properties of Earth (sun, moon, water, air)
3. Properties of life (reproduction, communication)
4. Things specific to our lives, but so common that they would need to be redefined often (human, eye, mouth, ear, hand, TBD)
